# Salesforce Clone (HTML & CSS)

This is a **Salesforce clone** created purely using **HTML** and **CSS** as a front-end practice project. The goal of this project is to replicate the look and feel of the Salesforce interface, focusing on layout, styling, and responsiveness without involving any backend or data functionality. Itâ€™s a great way to enhance UI/UX skills and better understand how to structure complex web pages.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

In this project, I have recreated the Salesforce dashboard layout including:

- A top navigation bar with links and search bar
- A sidebar with menu items
- Dashboard content area with cards, lists, and information blocks
- Forms and interactive-looking elements styled with CSS
- Consistent colors, spacing, and fonts to match the original design aesthetic

This clone is static and built entirely with HTML5 and CSS3. Itâ€™s intended to help improve layout design, responsive structure, and component styling.
